The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Website is dynamic. It can be viewed finely with all mobile devices
* [X] Images are dynamic. They change size accordingly.
* [X] implemented hamburger menu when switched to mobile view

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  The biggest challenge of designing this webpage is remembering all the
  small specifics of using HTML containers and bootstrap grid system. The
  specifics referred to are the use of the classes "text-center",
  "justify-content-around", "row" and "col". There were many different combinations
  of putting the parameters in the correction <div> container to make sure the
  HTML elements were placed correctly with respect to one another. Much practice
  is needed to make sure these parameters and using the Bootstrap grid system
  becomes second nature.
